  2. Examine a specific communicative context or example (e.g. political debate, interaction between customer and service representive, a messaging campaign in health communication, etc.) and explore whether and how LLMs might be used and the associated implications.
     
* Write a paper/report in Markdown using Zotero citations.


### Method

* Add notebooks, Markdown files, your BibTex bibliography file, PDFs, images etc. to the repo related to your project.
* The report should be in a Notebook and use the citation extension of JupyterLab to add citations.
* You can render the Notebook to PDF using "Save and Export as" function in JupyterLab.
* You make have additional notebooks or other files to show your empirical LLM work.
